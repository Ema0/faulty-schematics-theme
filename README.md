# Faulty Schematics

![Color identity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ema0/faulty-schematics-theme/main/images/icon.png)

Light theme for VSCode

Inspired by [Humming theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vtalstudios.humming-theme).

I changed the orange tone to the [International Orange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_orange) and made some other minor tweaks to tie the overall look together.


This theme is very in early dev. If you see any issues let me know.
