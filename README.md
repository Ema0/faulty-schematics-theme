Faulty Schematics theme for VSCode

Inspired by [Humming theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vtalstudios.humming-theme).
I changed the orange tone to the [International Orange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_orange) and made some other minor tweaks to tie the overall look together.
